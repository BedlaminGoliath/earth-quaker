## About the Project

This project is a downloadable mobel synth (music). So far this allows you play a note (A 444) and adjust the type of sound wave you wish this to be, sine, wave, square, sawtooth. besides the ability to play that note, you are able to apply a detune effect as well as a filter to the note being played. The idea of this app is to make it possible to create your own synth sounds on the go by adding many osciliators (stacking them) and then having the ability to apply those effects to manipulate the sound as you see fit.
